=begin

Write a program that iterates over an array and builds a new array that is the 
result of incrementing each value in the original array by a value of 2. 
You should have two arrays at the end of this program, The original array 
and the new array you've created. 
Print both arrays to the screen using the p method instead of puts.

=end

arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = arr1.map { |num| num + 2 }

p arr1
p arr2
